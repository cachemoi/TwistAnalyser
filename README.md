# TwistAnalyser

This set of programs predicts helical conformation features given the amino acid sequence. It implements the methods produced by Jordi Bella.

TwistAnalyser predicts the features using various input settings.

GenCol generates random collagen sequences.

RegInv checks if your helical features are register independent.

A version of TwistAnalyser writted solely in Javascript/CSS/HTML can be found in the folder 'JSTwistAnalyser'

A website was built to interact with the script. You can find the website at http://maxbautzer.me/

All files on the apache server hosting the website can be found in the "website" folder.

The python scripts should be relatively easy to tune so that they work on your machine. Just changing the filepaths in the FileInfo object should so it. You also need to be using Anaconda as your python interpreter.
