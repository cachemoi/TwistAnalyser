change strands places and see if there is K change
table of average K
evolutionary analysis

GXXGXXGXX time 5 is collagen

in fibrillar you have lots of them
I and 5 are heterotrimers/ register issues

A1

A2

or

A1

A1

is K,T register independent

how conserved are mean values

link with some measure of evolutionary proximity

is K and T proproportion of Pro/hydroxyPro

chimera structure comparaison?
