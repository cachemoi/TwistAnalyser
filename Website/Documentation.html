    <h2>
        Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
        This program will allow you to predict structural features in collagen molecules using a provided amino acid sequence
        according to a mathematical method published by Jordi Bella.
        You can find the paper <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847710000389">here.</a></p>

    <h2>
        Output
    </h2>
    <p>
        For each individual collagen molecule processed the program will yield the amino acid composition for your input protein.
        It will also give you a bar chart of the step distribution observed. A step is defined as a change in the amount of Proline
        between 3 local residues at one location and the three next ones.</p>
<p>

        For example, the program inputs a collagen molecule with strand 1, 2, and 3 (Fibrillar collagen is always composed of 3 strands).
        At the 30th amino acid on strands 1, 2, and 3 we have a Proline residue on strand 1 and 2, and at position 31 we get a Proline residue on strand3.
        This will be labelled as a 2-1 step and the helical values predicted by the mathematical equation will be assigned to that location along
        the collagen molecule. The values assigned are the internal triple helical twist (K°) and the internal triple helical translation t (Å)
</p>
<p>

        It is important to note that since we do not have the 3D coordinates for each residues, we assign the helical values according to sample
        values already calculated in Jordi Bella's paper. Those K and t values were predicted in fibrillar collagen, and the program
        will therefore work best for fibrillar collagen molecules.
    </p>
<h2>
    Additional features
</h2>
<p>
    A collagen domain is often composed of repeating units of Glycine followed by 2 other amino acids (GXY).
    By choosing the number of consecutive GXY units constituting a collagen domain in the parameters, you can extract your
    collagen domain from your sequence.
</p>
    <h2>
        Common errors
    </h2>
<p>
    If you wish to work with PDB sequences, it is best to increment your strands and omit the domain extraction option.
    This is because PDB collagen sequences are very small. They also have a disproportionally high P and G content. This is due to
    experimental realities, since it is easier to get the 3D structure of those small molecules.

    File handling on this website is done with html5, it will therefore work best with the latest browsers. Google Chrome is
    recommended.
